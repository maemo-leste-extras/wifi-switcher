# Now that the icon cache is uptodate, we move the .desktop file into

# reconstructing the menu before the icon is available.  This trick is
# not really necessary when using maemo-select-menu-location, since 
# maemo-select-menu-location will trigger the reconstructing of the 
# Task navigator menu as well.
